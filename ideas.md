# Ideas

## Project 1

| **Title** | Front-end and Adaptive Question Rendering | 
| **Description** | The goal is to make our clinical trial matching application more user friendly, specially for people with no medical knowledge. To achieve this we are implementing an algorithm that will generate a priority for the questions asked to the user. The contributr will be working on optimizing and implementing the REACTJS web application component to render many different types of questions with different types of input. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | A Adaptive web form that can change according to a JSON input, and embed this new component in the main application. |
| **Skills** | REACTJS, Javascript|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |

## Project 2

| **Title** | Self Generate Table 1 (also known as demographics table) | 
| **Description** | The table 1 is a summary table often found in papers and publications. It is usually the first table in those documents and for this reason called table 1. It consists in a descriptive distribution of the data. Each row consist in a variable (for instance age). Each column is a variable or a group of variables defining a category of distribution (for instance sex). And each intersection of the columns will have a count or a percentage of the population. So in this example The the cell [age : female] willl have the mean value of age for the female subjects in the dataset, the cell [age : male] will have the mean age for the male subjects and so on. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | A configurable table 1 that can handle both continous and categorical variable as well as combination of variables in the grouping definition. |
| **Skills** | Python, Javascript |

## Project 3
| **Title** | Improve the automation and the infrastructure as code cooverage of our infrastructure  | 
| **Description** | More than half of our codebase requires manual deployment and it is not easily reproducible without prior knowledge of the process. This process consist in improving the CI-CD pipeline. Most of our infrastructure resides in AWS, a secondary goal is to leverage terraform and extend the coverage to Google Cloud.|
| **Expected Outcomes** | Increasing by 10-15% the infrastructure as code and automation around it.|
| **Skills** | Terraform, AWS|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |

## Project 4

| **Title** | Improve the automation in testing | 
| **Description** | Set up a Jenkins pipeline to test our applications. Set up integration tests scenarios that are now runnig manually. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Having a working Jenkins pipeline with most test coverage.|
| **Skills** | Terraform, AWS|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |

## Project 5

| **Title** | Exploration of a new Component of the opensource GEN3 framework | 
| **Description** | The contributor will be evaluating the new GEN3 frontend framework. This will include deploying it locally, try different customizations. In addition if this will be considered as a useful REACTJS app the contributor will migrate the main component from our current REACTJS frontend application to the new frontend framework. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Either the migration of our main components to the new application in case the discovery of the new tool has positive results or removing the new frontend framework migration from our roadmap. |
| **Skills** | Javascript, REACTJS |
