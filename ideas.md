## Project 1

| **Title** | Enhancing the SMART on FHIR Backend for Patient-Controlled Data Sharing | 
| **Description** | The goal of this project is to improve and extend the backend of a SMART on FHIR application that empowers patients to autonomously access, share, and manage their electronic health records (EHR). The application serves as a data interoperability layer, allowing users to seamlessly transfer their healthcare data to meet various needs, such as research participation, second opinions, or personal health tracking. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | One or both of the following: Improving the integration with diverse FHIR servers and refining data transformation capabilities. Building APIs or plugins to support additional healthcare applications and third-party services. |
| **Skills** | Java, python|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 2

| **Title** | Enhancing the SMART on FHIR Frontend for Patient-Controlled Data Sharing | 
| **Description** | This project aims to improve the frontend user interface for a SMART on FHIR application that enables patients to autonomously access, manage, and share their electronic health records (EHR). The focus is on making the UI more intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience for users connecting to the backend service. This project build and enhance last year project. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Extend support to more EHR provider connections. |
| **Skills** | Javascript, Node |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |

| **Rating** | medium|


## Project 3

| **Title** | Enhancing a FHIR Resource Tabular Viewer for Efficient Data Exploration  | 
| **Description** | This project aims to enhance a FHIR Resource Tabular Viewer, an application that transforms complex, nested FHIR data structures into an easy-to-navigate tabular format. This tool will allow users—such as researchers, clinicians, and developers—to efficiently search, filter, and analyze FHIR resources, improving accessibility and usability of healthcare data. This project build and enhance last year project. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Enhanced resource management and visualization and extend support to more data source, like local file, and S3 buckets. |
| **Skills** | Python, Javascript |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 4

| **Title** | Enhancing a Chatbot for Generating GraphQL and Custom Queries for Cohort Descriptions | 
| **Description** | This project aims to enhance a chatbot powered by ChatGPT or another large language model (LLM) that allows users to describe a cohort of patients and automatically generates GraphQL queries or custom queries based on the input for the [PCDC](https://portal.pedscommons.org){:target="_blank"}. The goal is to simplify the process of building complex queries for patient data by allowing users to interact with the chatbot in natural language, rather than navigating through a UI or manually searching for filters. This project build and enhance last year project. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Interactive chatbot - Agent for capturing various user intent/needs and routing the requests to tools: general inquiry, Browsing documentation (currently in progress), Generating GraphQL. |
| **Skills** | LLM, Javascript |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | hard |

Improve the GraphQL generator for simple and complex query conformed to PCDC data model
Evaluation: evaluate the output against saved GraphQL queries (filterset)
Develop GraphQL generator as a part of Interactive chatbot - Agent for capturing various user intent/needs and routing the requests to tools
Tool 1: general inquiry
Tool 2: Browsing documentation (currently in progress)
Tool 3: Generating GraphQL
Any function, that would be useful in cohort discovery


## Project 5 

| **Title** | Data Density Heatmap Application | 
| **Description** | The goal of this project is to develop a web-based heatmap visualization tool that represents the completeness and distribution of data across an entire dataset. The application will display data “density” by GraphQL node types and their specific attributes, enabling users to quickly identify areas with high or low data availability. This tool is intended to support researchers and data managers in assessing dataset quality and guiding curation efforts. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | A fully functional, configuration-driven heatmap application that dynamically generates visualizations from live GraphQL endpoints.  |
| **Skills** | Javascript, D3 (or similar visualization libraries) |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 6

| **Title** | Enhance GEARBOx trial matching page   | 
| **Description** | This project aims to create a new user experience. The current implementation has teh user looking at a list of all available trials related questions, and has to respond to as many as possible with the available data by scrolling a very long column. The new version will have a typeahead search or a dropdown with search where the user can search and select only the filter he has data for. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | New working UI page |
| **Skills** | Python, Typescript |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 7

| **Title** | Generating decision tree (or flow chart)   | 
| **Description** | Generating decision tree (or flowchart) from free-text and GEARBOx Doccano annotation data. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Decision tree in json format used in admin UI in order to determine priority and order of criteria. Map to patient data: synthetic patient data or EHR data (If patient data is available). |
| **Skills** | Python, Typescript |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
