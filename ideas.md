## Project 1

| **Title** | Enhancing the SMART on FHIR Backend for Patient-Controlled Data Sharing | 
| **Description** | The goal of this project is to improve and extend the backend of a SMART on FHIR application that empowers patients to autonomously access, share, and manage their electronic health records (EHR). The application serves as a data interoperability layer, allowing users to seamlessly transfer their healthcare data to meet various needs, such as research participation, second opinions, or personal health tracking. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | One or both of the following: Improving the integration with diverse FHIR servers and refining data transformation capabilities. Building APIs or plugins to support additional healthcare applications and third-party services. |
| **Skills** | Java, python|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |

## Project 2

| **Title** | Enhancing the SMART on FHIR Frontend for Patient-Controlled Data Sharing | 
| **Description** | This project aims to improve the frontend user interface for a SMART on FHIR application that enables patients to autonomously access, manage, and share their electronic health records (EHR). The focus is on making the UI more intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience for users connecting to the backend service. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Improved User Experience (UX) |
| **Skills** | Javascript, Node |

## Project 3

| **Title** | Developing a FHIR Resource Tabular Viewer for Efficient Data Exploration  | 
| **Description** | This project aims to build a FHIR Resource Tabular Viewer, an application that transforms complex, nested FHIR data structures into an easy-to-navigate tabular format. This tool will allow users—such as researchers, clinicians, and developers—to efficiently search, filter, and analyze FHIR resources, improving accessibility and usability of healthcare data. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Tabular Representation of FHIR Data and Search & Filtering Capabilities. |
| **Skills** | Python, Javascript |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 4

| **Title** | Improve the automation in testing | 
| **Description** | Establish a Jenkins pipeline to automate the testing of our applications. Additionally, configure integration test scenarios that are currently executed manually. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Establishing a functional Jenkins pipeline with comprehensive test coverage. |
| **Skills** | Terraform, AWS|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 5

| **Title** | Exploration of a new Component of the opensource GEN3 framework | 
| **Description** | The contributor will assess the viability of the new GEN3 frontend framework, involving tasks such as local deployment and exploration of various customizations. If the framework proves to be a valuable REACTJS application, the contributor will proceed to migrate the main component from our existing REACTJS frontend application to this new frontend framework. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Either migrate our main components to the new application if the new tool yields positive results or remove the migration of the new frontend framework from our roadmap. |
| **Skills** | Javascript, REACTJS |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
