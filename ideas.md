# Ideas

## Project 1

| **Title** | Front-end and Adaptive Question Rendering | 
| **Description** | The goal is to make our clinical trial matching application more user friendly, specially for people with no medical knowledge. To achieve this we are implementing an algorithm that will generate a priority for the questions asked to the user. The contributr will be working on optimizing and implementing the REACTJS web application component to render many different types of questions with different types of input. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | A Adaptive web form that can change according to a JSON input, and embed this new component in the main application. |
| **Skills** | REACTJS, Javascript|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 2

| **Title** | Self Generate Table 1 (also known as demographics table) | 
| **Description** | The table 1 is a summary table often found in papers and publications. It is usually the first table in those documents and for this reason called table 1. It consists in a descriptive distribution of the data. Each row consist in a variable (for instance age). Each column is a variable or a group of variables defining a category of distribution (for instance sex). And each intersection of the columns will have a count or a percentage of the population. So in this example The the cell [age : female] willl have the mean value of age for the female subjects in the dataset, the cell [age : male] will have the mean age for the male subjects and so on. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | A configurable table 1 that can handle both continous and categorical variable as well as combination of variables in the grouping definition. |
| **Skills** | Python, Javascript |
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | hard|

## Project 3
| **Title** | Improve the automation and the infrastructure as code cooverage of our infrastructure  | 
| **Description** | More than half of our codebase requires manual deployment and it is not easily reproducible without prior knowledge of the process. This process consist in improving the CI-CD pipeline. Most of our infrastructure resides in AWS, a secondary goal is to leverage terraform and extend the coverage to Google Cloud.|
| **Expected Outcomes** | Increasing by 10-15% the infrastructure as code and automation around it.|
| **Skills** | Terraform, AWS|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |


## Project 4
| **Title** | Improve the automation in testing | 
| **Description** | Set up a Jenkins pipeline to test our applications. Set up integration tests scenarios that are now runnig manually. |
| **Expected Outcomes** | Having a working Jenkins pipeline with most test coverage.|
| **Skills** | Terraform, AWS|
| **Mentors** | TBD - One of the Senior Developer in the team. |
| **Project Size** | 350 hours |
| **Rating** | medium |

Each project on the Ideas list should include: a) a project title/description b) more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences) c) expected outcomes d) skills required/preferred e) possible mentors f) expected size of project (90, 175 or 350 hour â€“ yes, 3 options starting in 2023). And if possible, an easy, medium or hard rating of each project. This helps the more inexperience folks not get overwhelmed and they can focus on reviewing easy project ideas.



Low-hanging fruit: These projects require minimal familiarity with the codebase and basic technical knowledge. They are relatively short, with clear goals.

Risky/Exploratory: These projects push the scope boundaries of your development effort. They might require expertise in an area not covered by your current development team. They might take advantage of a new technology. There is a reasonable chance that the project might be less successful, but the potential rewards make it worth the attempt.

Fun/Peripheral: These projects might not be related to the current core development focus, but create new innovations and new perspective for your project.


Infrastructure/Automation: These projects are the code that your organization uses to get its development work done; for example, projects that improve the automation of releases, regression tests and automated builds. This is a category in which a GSoC contributor can be really helpful, doing work that the development team has been putting off while they focus on core development.
